# MNIST-CFAR Image Denoising using GANs

This repository implements various Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for denoising and deblurring images from the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The project explores the use of Deblur GAN, Vanilla GAN, and Patch GAN architectures.

## Installation

To run the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow  # or pytorch
```

##Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayush-developer/MNIST-CFAR---Image-Denoising-using-GANS.git
cd MNIST-CFAR---Image-Denoising-using-GANS
```

## Models

Deblur GAN: A GAN specifically designed to remove blur from images.
Vanilla GAN: The standard GAN architecture for generating new data.
Patch GAN: A GAN that focuses on generating images in patches, improving local details.

## Results

The repository includes results comparing the performance of each GAN architecture on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
